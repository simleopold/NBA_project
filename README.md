# THE INFLUENCE OF KEY STATISTICAL METRICS ON TEAM SUCCESS IN THE NBA: A BRADLEY-TERRY MODEL APPROACH

This repository presents a statistical modeling project focused on evaluating how in-game metrics (such as turnovers, rebounds, assists, and shooting percentages) influence NBA team success over a season. Using Bradley-Terry models (static and dynamic), we aim to link match outcomes with performance indicators and assess team abilities and ranking accuracy.
